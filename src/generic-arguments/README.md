# Generic Arguments

This util for generic arguments usage.

# Description

This example shows how to use generic arguments in a function. The function is called `sendRequestWithGenericArgument` and it takes a generic argument `T` which is a string. The function returns a `Responses` type which is a union type of all possible responses. The function takes a variable number of arguments. The first argument is the `type` of the request. The second argument is the `payload` of the request. The `payload` is optional. The function returns a `Responses` type which is a union type of all possible responses. The function uses the `Extract` utility type to extract the `payload` from the `Requests` type. The `Extract` utility type is used to infer the `TPayload` type from the `payload` property of the `Requests` type. The `Extract` utility type is used to infer the `T` type from the `type` property of the `Requests` type. The `Extract` utility type is used to infer the `T` type from the `type` property of the `Requests` type. The `Extract` utility type is used to infer the `T` type from the `type` property of the `Requests` type. The `Extract` utility type is used to infer the `T` type from the `type` property of the `Requests` type. The `Extract` utility type is used to infer the `T` type from the `type` property of the `Requests` type. The `Extract` utility type is used to infer the `T` type from the `type` property of the `Requests` type. The `Extract` utility type is used to infer the `T` type from the `type` property of the `Requests` type. The `Extract` utility type is used to infer the `T` type from the `type` property of the `Requests` type. The `Extract` utility type is used to infer the `T` type from the `type` property of the `Requests` type. The `Extract` utility type is used to infer the `T` type from the `type` property of the `Requests` type.
