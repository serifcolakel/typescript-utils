# Get Deep Value

This util for get deep value from object.

# Description

1. We define a generic type for the object and keys.
2. We define the generic types for the keys. We need to do this otherwise the keys will not be recognized as keys.
3. We define the function with the object and keys as arguments.
4. The function returns the value of the object with the given keys.
5. We use the conditional operator to check if the second key is given. If not, we return the value of the first key.
6. We use the conditional operator to check if the third key is given. If not, we return the value of the second key.
7. We use the conditional operator to check if the fourth key is given. If not, we return the value of the third key.
8. If the fourth key is given, we return the value of the fourth key.
9. We could continue to add more keys. We could also add more keys to the conditional operator.
